description: A basic overview of editing the Englert Lab Website
---

# 📚 Overview

The Englert Lab website was designed based off of the **Lab Website Template (LWT)** toolkit developed by Dr. Casey Green and Vincent Rubinetti at the University of Colorado - Anschutz Medical Campus. However, there are a few key differences, custom scripts, and other additions that add a bit more power to the Englert Lab Website.



The purpose of this lab website is to be a central ground for keeping up with new publications, members, and more!
